# Introduction

## Context

### Tropical deforestation

\centering \includegraphics[width=8cm]{figs/Vancutsem2021}

**Vancutsem et al.** 2021, _Science Advances_, doi: [10.1126/sciadv.abe1603](https//doi.org10.1126/sciadv.abe1603)

- Tropical Moist Forest (TMF)
- 1990--2019: Annual deforestation, degradation, regeneration

### Tropical deforestation

- Full Landsat archive (1982--2019), 30m pixel, time-series analysis
- Classification tree based on expert knowledge
- Tropical deforestation was underestimated (-33% in 2000--2012, Hansen et al. 2013)
- Maps and data: <https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/TMF/>

\vspace{0.25cm}
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Vancutsem2021-maps-wide}

### Tropical deforestation

- Precise enough to visually identify the causes of deforestation (logging, fires, agriculture)

\centering \includegraphics[height=0.7\textheight]{figs/Vancutsem2021-patterns}

## Objectives

### Forecasting deforestation

- About 7 Mha of tropical moist forest are disappearing each year (size of Ireland)
- At this rate, will tropical forests still exist in 2100?
- If yes, where will they be located?
- What will be the consequences of future deforestation on biodiversity and carbon emissions?

\vspace{0.5cm}
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/Vancutsem2021-maps-2100}

### Forecasting deforestation

Why is it a timely question?

- **Alert** decision makers
- Carbon emissions scenarios ($\rightarrow$ IPCC)
- Biodiversity scenarios ($\rightarrow$ IPBES)
- Local scale: systematic conservation planning (protected area network, REDD$+$)
- Modelling $\rightarrow$ main spatial drivers of deforestation

\vspace{0.10cm}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{figs/ipcc.png}    
**IPCC scenarios**

### Forecasting deforestation **spatially**

Why is **spatial** forecasting important?

Because both biodiversity and carbon stocks vary strongly in space.

## Approach

- **i\.** Consider tropical moist forest in **92** countries (119 study areas)
- **ii\.** Estimate the current deforestation rate and uncertainty in each country
- **iii\.** Model the spatial risk of deforestation from environmental factors
- **iv\.** Forecast the deforestation assuming a business-as-usual scenario
- **v\.** Consequences in terms of biodiversity and carbon emissions

# Methods

## Models

### Modelling the intensity of deforestation

\bcols
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

- 10 values of annual deforested area (ha/yr) in 2010--2020 per country
- (Brazil: per state, India: per region)
- Mean deforestation rate (ha/yr) in 2010--2020 per country
- Uncertainty around the mean (95% confidence interval)

### Modelling the spatial risk of deforestation

\bcols
\bcol{0.5\textwidth}

A logistic regression model with iCAR process

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
  y_i \sim \mathcal{B}ernoulli(\theta_i)\\
  \text{logit}(\theta_i) = \alpha + X_i \beta + \rho_{j(i)}\\
  \rho_{j(i)} \sim \mathcal{N}ormal(\sum_{j^{\prime}} \rho_{j^{\prime}} / n_j,V_{\rho} / n_j)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\footnotesize (NB: We compared this model with a simple GLM and a Random Forest model using a cross-validation procedure)

### Spatial variables

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/sm/var.png}

**Spatial explanatory variables in DRC**

### Roads

- OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- "motorway", "trunk", "primary", "secondary" and "tertiary" roads
- 3.6 million roads from OSM

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/sm/roads.png}

### Protected areas

- PA status: "Designated", "Inscribed", "Established", or "Proposed" before 1\textsuperscript{st} January 2010
- 85,000 protected areas from WDPA

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/sm/pa.png}

### Sampling

One word on sampling:

- Stratified sampling between deforested/non-deforested pixels in 2010--2020
- Total number of points proportional to the forest cover in 2010 (from 20,000 to 100,000 points per study area)
- Huge data-set of 3.2 M forest pixels (~288 Kha of forest)

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/sm/sample.png}

## Forecast

### Spatial random effects

**Interpolation of spatial random effects at 1km in DRC**

### Spatial probability of deforestation

We use the fitted model to compute the spatial probability of deforestation.

### Future forest cover

- Total deforested area $D$ (ha) in a given period of time $Y$ (yr): $D=d \times Y$, with $d$ the annual deforested area (ha/yr).
- Number of pixels to be deforested: $n=D/0.09$, 0.09 ha being the pixel area.
- The $n$ pixels with the highest deforestation probabilities are considered deforested in that period of time.

# Results

## Forest refuge areas

### Tropical forest cover loss

\small
75% of the tropical forest existing in 2000 will be lost in 2100, 2150, and 2200 in Asia, Africa, and America, respectively.

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/article/perc_loss_cont}

### Tropical forest cover loss

\small
- 20 countries, 5 states in Brazil, and 1 region in India (having > 1 Mha of forest in 2020) will lose all their tropical forest by 2100.
- No more tropical forests in 6 biodiversity hotspots (extinction of 29,140 endemic species of plants and 4,576 species of vertebrates).

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/defor-tab}

### Pantropical map of the future forest cover

\small
Tropical forests in 2100 will be (i) highly fragmented, (ii) concentrated in remote areas (far from roads and towns), pref. in protected areas, and at high elevations.

## Carbon emissions

- Future deforestation will impact forests with higher carbon stocks
- Annual carbon emissions will increase from 0.525 Pg/yr in 2010–2020 to 0.746 Pg/yr in 2070–2080 (42% increase)

# Discussion

## Uncertainty analysis

### Uncertainty analysis

- Despite uncertainty, results are clear and alarming.
- "Business-as-usual" scenario $\neq$ what **will** happen in the future.
- "Business-as-usual" scenario $=$ in the absence of any change.
- The objective is to alert and create a momentum for change.
- Nonetheless, rather optimistic scenario.

\vspace{0.25cm}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/madame-irma}

## Alternative scenarios

### Alternative scenarios: demography and demand

- Demography: in Africa, a large part of the population depends on slash-and-burn agriculture for their livelihood.
- Increasing demand for agricultural commodities: e.g., palm oil, Corley et al. 2009

\centering \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figs/oil-palm-proj}

## Other perspectives

### Other perspectives

- Models can be refined locally (e.g., Ivory-Coast, Madagascar, New-Caledonia) with more information on the context.
- Very rough estimates of biodiversity loss: need for world biodiversity maps.
- (Fragmentation study, regeneration potential, etc.)
