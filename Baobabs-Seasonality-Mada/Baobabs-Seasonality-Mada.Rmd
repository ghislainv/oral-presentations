# Introduction

### Isotherms

Species should move towards the poles and upslope to track shifting isotherms as climate warms:

- Temperature is an easy to measure climatic variable (Fahrenheit, 1724).
- Temperature is a strong determinant of species biology and distribution.
- Concept of isotherm (Alexander von Humboldt / 1769--1859).

### Temperature and CO$_2$

- Temperature is strongly correlated with CO$_2$ concentration in the atmosphere.

### Scientific question

- Species should move poleward and upslope: is it always true?
- Case of the seven baobab species of Madagascar

### Baobabs of Madagascar

- Seven species out of the height baobab species existing on Earth.
- Six are **endemic** to Madagascar.
- Emblematic species (Baobabs' Alley), representative of the biodiversity of Madagascar.
- High endemism (>85%) in almost all taxonomic groups.

# Methods

### Species distribution models

- Species distribution models.
- 1\. Species climatic niche, 2\. Current distribution, 3\. Future distribution (2055, 2085).
- **Ensemble modelling**: four statistical algorithms (GLM, GAM, RF, MaxEnt).
- **Ensemble forecasting**: three Global Circulation Models (NorESM1-M, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-ES).
- **Two dispersal scenarios**: full dispersal (possible dispersal outside current range), zero dispersal (no dispersal outside current range).
- Presence: the majority of the models predicts a presence. Uncertainty: number of models predicting a presence.

### Occurrence data

\bcols

- Large occurrence data-base.
- Since 2000, field inventories and photo-interpretation of satellite images.

### Climatic data

- Four climatic variables: mean annual temperature (tmean, °C), annual precipitation (precip, mm/yr), temperature seasonality (tseas, °C sd x 1000), climatic water deficit (cwd, mm/yr).
- Two climatic scenarios: RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5.
- WorldClim data.

### Ecological interpretation of SDMs

General use of SDMs in the studies on climate change:

- Correlative models used to derive maps of species range.
- Species vulnerability to climatic change (range contraction or expansion).
- Not much ecological interpretation of the results.

We wanted to push the interpretation further:

- Climatic anomalies in space in the future.
- Variable importance in determining species niche.
- Climate change in current species range.
- Species range shift in latitude and elevation.
- Relationship between temperature and latitude/elevation in Madagascar.

# Results

### Range contraction

### Range contraction

- Four species will experience a strong range contraction (>70%) under RCP 8.5 in 2085.
- Out of these four species, three are threatened by a change in temperature seasonality.

# Discussion

### Species range shift

- Some species might move equatorward to track change in temperature seasonality.
- Range shift direction depends on several things: species climatic niche (variable importance), climatic anomalies in space in the future.
- It is not contradictory to move both equatorward and upslope.

### Generalization to the tropics

- General increase of temperature seasonality in the tropics.
- Tropical species usually adapted to low seasonality (cf. tree growth, phenology).

### Perspectives

- What does it mean an increase in seasonality under climate change? (much warmer rainy season or colder dry season?)
