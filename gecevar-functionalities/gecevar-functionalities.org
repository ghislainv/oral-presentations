* Introduction

** Context

*** Context                                                        

- Ecology is the study of the relationships among living organisms and their physical environment.
- Use of spatial environmental and climatic layers is inevitable in ecology.
- (NB: Here, environmental variable = any environmental variable which is not climatic). 
- Study of the link between environment/climate and: species occurrence, species demography, individual traits, community characteristic (e.g. diversity, productivity, biomass, community weighted mean), etc.

*** Data online

- Many global climatic and environmental data are available online.
- Climate: WorldClim, Chelsa.
- Elevation: SRTM, protected areas: WDPA, population: WorldPop, soil: SoilGrids, forest cover: Global Forest Change or Tropical Moist Forests, etc.
- Data are usually available at various resolution (SRTM: 90m), (WorlClim, Chelsa: \geq 30 arc sec). 
- Building a data-set from all these source that can be used in ecological studies is challenging.

*** Time consuming and repetitive tasks

**** Time consuming                                              :B_block:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:END:
- Many environmental variables (topography, soil, climate, etc.).
- Environment and climatic data are spread in different databases.
- Long computations if region is large and resolution is high.
- Downloading rasters at global scale can take a lot of time.
**** Repetitive                                            :B_block:BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:BEAMER_col: 0.7
:END: 
- We usually repeat this work for every region we are working on.
- For future climate data: repetition for each global climate model, scenario (SSP), and period (eg. 2055, 2085).

*** Technically challenging steps

**** Text                                                          :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: 0.7
:END:

- Several technical geoprocessing steps: crop to an extent, resample on a given grid (extent and resolution), combine data in one raster.
- Some variables are missing and must be computed (number of dry months or average from climatic models).
- Intensive computations if region is large and resolution is high (raster might not fit in memory).
- Imply the use of technical geoprocessing software: R packages (terra, star, sf), gdal, GRASS GIS, Google Earth Engine.

- Download of large global rasters available online can be very long.
- Here we make use of COGs: Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs.
- A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud
- Download of a sample of the global raster. 
- Use of the =gdal_translate= function in GDAL which allows using the =/vsicurl= virtual file system as input.
