* Introduction

** Context

*** Context                                                        

- Ecology is the study of the relationships among living organisms and their physical environment.
- Use of spatial environmental and climatic layers is inevitable in ecology.
- (NB: Here, environmental variable = any environmental variable which is not climatic). 
- Study of the link between environment/climate and: species occurrence, species demography, individual traits, community characteristic (e.g. diversity, productivity, biomass, community weighted mean), etc.

*** Technically challenging steps

- Several technical geoprocessing steps: crop to an extent, resample on a given grid (extent and resolution), combine data in one raster.
- Some variables are missing and must be computed (number of dry months or average from climatic models).
- Intensive computations if region is large and resolution is high (raster might not fit in memory).
- Imply the use of technical geoprocessing software: R packages (terra, star, sf), gdal, GRASS GIS, Google Earth Engine.

*** Time consuming and repetitive tasks

**** Time consuming                                              :B_block:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:END:
- Many environmental variables (topography, soil, climate, land cover, disturbances, etc.).
- Environment and climatic data are spread in different databases.
- Long computations if region is large and resolution is high.
- Downloading full rasters at global scale before cropping can take a lot of time.

**** Repetitive                                                  :B_block:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:END: 
- We usually repeat this work for every region we are working on.
- For future climate data: repetition for each global climate model, scenario (SSP), and period (eg. 2055, 2085).

** Objectives

*** Objectives
- Provide an R package to ease the creation of a dataset with environmental and climatic variables for any particular region.
- With easy-to-use and well documented functions.
- Using efficient code and tools to fasten the creation of the dataset.
- \rightarrow Aims of the =gecevar= R package we will be presenting.

- =get_env_variables=: Raster file with 13 environmental variables.
- =get_chelsa_current=: Raster file with 107 variables from Chelsa describing current climate (1981--2010).
- =get_chelsa_future=: Raster file with 81 variables from Chelsa describing future climate (for each GCM, SSP, and period).

By default, the user has to provide only one of the following:
- Country ISO code.
- Shapefile with polygons delimiting the region of interest.
- Extent (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) of the region of interest.
  
** Variables

*** Environmental variables

**** Sources
Various sources: SRTM, SoilGrids, Tropical Moist Forests, OpenStreetMap, WDPA. 

**** Topography                                                  :B_block:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:END:
Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Roughness.

**** Other environmental variables
Solar irradiance, Soil, Forest cover, Distances to forest, sea, road, town, water, Protected areas.

*** Current climatic variables

**** Source
Chelsa ([[https://chelsa-climate.org)][chelsa-climate.org]])

**** Bioclimatic variables
- The monthly min, max and mean temperature and monthly precipitation (48 variables).
- The 19 commonly used bioclimatic variables (11 from temperature and 8 from precipitation).

**** Other climatic variables
- Cloud area fraction, PET, Climatic water deficit (CWD), Number of dry months (NDM).
- For PET and derived variables (CWD, NDM): Penman-Monteith or Thornthwaite equation.

*** Future climate

**** Source
- Chelsa ([[https://chelsa-climate.org)][chelsa-climate.org]])
- GCMs: GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, UKESM1-0-LL.
- SSPs: Shared Socio-economic Pathways (126, 370, 585).
- Periods: 2041--2070, 2071--2100.

**** Future climate
- Most of the climatic variables for each GCM, SSP, and period of time.
- Exception: no Penman-Monteith PET and derived variables.
- Averages from the 5 GCMs (ensemble model).

** Specificities

*** Software used

- Heavy use of GDAL (=gdalwarp=, =gdalbuilvrt=, =gdal_translate=, =gdaldem=, =gdal_proximity=).
- GRASS GIS software for solar irradiance, (TWI).
- =osmextract= R package for extracting OSM data.
- =terra=, =stars= and =sf= R packages for manipulating spatial objects.

*** Cloud optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)

**** COGs                                                        :B_block:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: block
:END:
- Download of large global rasters available online can be very long.
- Here we make use of COGs: Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs.
- A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud
- Download of a sample of the global raster. 
- Use of the =gdal_translate= function in GDAL which allows using the =/vsicurl= virtual file system as input.

**** Some ressources on COGs                                     :B_block:
