** Context

*** Context                                                        

- Paris Agreement on climate change
- REDD+: Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation
- IMPRESS (Improving Measurement for Payments to Reduce Emissions and Strengthen Sinks) FAO -- UK-PACT project

** Objectives

*** Objectives

- Given a deforestation intensity (ha/yr), how to allocate deforestation *spatially*? \Rightarrow Map of deforestation risk
- Develop a tool to derive an accurate map of the deforestation risk
- Following JNR methodology
- Using only an historical forest cover change map on a recent period

** Functions

*** Main package functions

The riskmapjnr package includes functions to:

    1. Estimate the distance to forest edge beyond which the deforestation risk is negligible: =dist_edge_threshold()=.
    2. Compute local deforestation rates using a moving window whose size can vary: =local_defor_rate()=.
    3. Transform local deforestation rates into categories of deforestation risks using several slicing algorithms: =set_defor_cat_zero()= and =defor_cat()=
    4. Validate maps of deforestation risk and select the map with the higher accuracy: =defrate_per_cat()= and =validation()=.
      
*** Distance to forest edge threshold

- =rmj.dist_edge_threshold()=: Compute the distance to the forest edge after which the risk of deforestation becomes negligible.
- Here, >99% of deforestation occurs within a distance \leq180m.
- Forest pixels with a distance >180m will be in Category 0 (zero risk of deforestation).

*** Local deforestation rate

- =rmj.local_defor_rate()=: Compute a local risk of deforestation at the pixel level using a moving window made of several pixels.
- Different window sizes can be chosen.
- The JNR methodology recommends the use of 25 different window sizes.

*** Categorize the deforestation risk

- =rmj.defor_cat()=: Convert local deforestation rate into categories of deforestation risk.
- The JNR methodology suggests to use _31 categories of risk_ from "0" to "30" (including the "0" category).
- The JNR methodology recommends the use of _three slicing algorithms_: "equal area", "equal interval", and "natural breaks".
  - "equal area": each class covers approximately the same area
  - "equal interval": bins of the same range size
  - "natural breaks": data are normalized before applying the "equal interval" algorithm.

* Perspectives

** Comments

*** Additional tests

- *!!* First results
- Code might include some errors
- Functions still need to be thoroughly tested
- Results must be consolidated

** Alternative approach

*** Comparison with the =forestatrisk= approach

- Alternative approach to compute the deforestation risk
- Statistical model estimating the deforestation risk \theta
- \theta = function(environmental variables + location)
- Variables: distance to forest edge, roads, towns, protected areas
