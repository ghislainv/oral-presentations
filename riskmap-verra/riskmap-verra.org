* Introduction

** Improving certification methodologies

*** Several criticisms

Several criticisms were addressed to previous REDD+ methodologies for carbon credit certification accusing them to oversell credits.

- *Non-additionnality*: Emissions reductions would have happened anyway. Inflated project-level baselines. Jurisdictional reference levels are reasonably good predictors of future trends. 
- *Leakage*: The larger the area covered by a REDD+ initiative, the lower the leakage risk.
- *Reversal*: Jurisdictions are less likely than projects to have their forest carbon stocks decimated by a disturbance event.

*** New jurisdictional approach

  - Baseline activity data or Forest Reference Emission Level at the jurisdictional level
  - Amount of deforestation.
  - Deforestation "quantity" or "intensity".
    
**** Spatial deforestation risk                                  :B_block:

  - Map of the deforestation risk at the jurisdictional level.
  - Spatial relative probability of deforestation.
  - Deforestation "location".

** Allocating deforestation to projects

*** Risk map at the jurisdictional level

- Identifying hot-spots/cold-spots of deforestation.
- Classifying forest pixels by risk of being deforested.
- One unique model for the whole jurisdiction (no methodological discrepancies between projects).
- Use this map to allocate deforestation (estimated for the jurisdiction) per project.

*** Allocating deforestation to projects

- Jurisdictional risk map: a map with class of deforestation risk.
- Obtaining a deforestation density map:\newline Class of defor. risk [1, 2, ..., $I$] $\rightarrow$ Defor. density (ha/yr/pixel).
- Can be used to allocate deforestation per project.

* Verra's tool VT0007 for risk maps

** VT0007 methodology

*** VT0007 methodology

- Developed by Clark University (J. R. Eastman and R. G. Pontius Jr.) for Verra.
- *Aim*: Obtaining the best risk map possible at the jurisdictional level.

**** Basic steps                                                 :B_block:

1. Use a reasonably good reference model to map the deforestation risk.
2. Let the user propose alternative maps from alternative models.
3. Validation step: check that alternative models are better than the benchmark model.
4. Use the best alternative map to allocate deforestation.

*** Modelling periods 

#+attr_latex: :width 9cm
[[file:figs/get_started/periods.png]]

- Three dates: t1, t2, t3.
- Four periods: calibration, validation, historical, (baseline validity period).
- Why different periods: model predictions must be compared with *independent data* (validation period).
- To forecast after t3, we want to use as much data as possible (historical period).

** Benchmark model

*** Benchmark model

*** Deforestation density

** Alternative models and validation

*** Alternative models

*** Validation procedure

** Verra/UClark software

*** Verra/UClark software

https://github.com/ClarkCGA/UDef-ARP/tree/v2.09

- User must provide fcc, distance to forest edge raster, subjurisdictional borders.
- Benchmark model.
- Validation.

*** Limitations

- Not tool to help prepare the data.
- No tool to develop the alternative model.
- Windows only.
- Require a computer with high RAM for large jurisdiction: all raster inputs are stored in RAM during processing. Therefore, large jurisdictions will require substantial RAM allocations (e.g., 64Gb).
- Several remarks:

* Software for modelling deforestation

** Existing software

*** Existing software
- Dinamica EGO, CLUE, TerraSet (Clark U.).

** Limitations

*** Limitations
- All are not open source (transparency).
- Difficulty to reproduce the results (transparency, reproducibility).
- Large rasters on large jurisdiction ?
- No scripting: not well adapted to repeat computation.

* Conclusion

** A not so simple methodology

*** A not so simple methodology

** Need for an integrative tool: deforisk QGIS plugin
