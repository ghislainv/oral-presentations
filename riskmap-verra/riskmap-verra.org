* Introduction

** Improving certification methodologies

*** Several criticisms to project-based approach

Several criticisms were addressed to previous REDD+ methodologies for carbon credit certification accusing them to oversell credits.

- *Non-additionnality*: Emissions reductions would have happened anyway. Inflated project-level baselines. Jurisdictional reference levels are reasonably good predictors of future trends. 
- *Leakage*: The larger the area covered by a REDD+ initiative, the lower the leakage risk.
- *Reversal*: Jurisdictions are less likely than projects to have their forest carbon stocks decimated by a disturbance event.

Frances Seymour (WRI): [[https://www.wri.org/insights/insider-4-reasons-why-jurisdictional-approach-redd-crediting-superior-project-based][4 Reasons Why a Jurisdictional Approach for REDD+ Crediting Is Superior to a Project-Based Approach]].

*** Allocating deforestation to projects

- Jurisdictional risk map: a map with class of deforestation risk.
- Obtaining a deforestation density map:\newline Class of defor. risk [1, 2, ..., $I$] $\rightarrow$ Defor. density (ha/yr/pixel).
- Can be used to allocate deforestation per project.

* Verra methodology for risk mapping

** VT0007 tool

*** VT0007 tool

- Developed by Clark University (J. R. Eastman and R. G. Pontius Jr.) for Verra.
- *Aim*: Obtaining the best risk map possible at the jurisdictional level.

1. Use a reasonably good reference model to map the deforestation risk.
2. Let the user propose alternative maps from alternative models.
3. Validation step: check that alternative models are better than the benchmark model.
4. Use the best alternative map to allocate deforestation.

*** Modelling periods 

#+attr_latex: :width 9cm
[[file:figs/get_started/periods.png]]

- Three dates: t1, t2, t3.
- Four periods: calibration, validation, historical, (baseline validity period).
- Why different periods: model predictions must be compared with *independent data* (validation period).
- To forecast after t3, we want to use as much data as possible (historical period).

** Benchmark model

*** Benchmark model

- Benchmark model or reference model.
- A reasonably good deforestation model (better than a null model).
- Assuming a /decrease of deforestation with distance to forest edge/ (commonly admitted).
- And a /different model between subjurisdictions/ (regional variability).

#+caption: Subjurisdictions in Martinique (MTQ)
#+attr_latex: :width 3.5cm
[[file:figs/subj.png]]

*** Distance threshold

- Identify the distance to forest edge below which *99.5%* of the deforestation occur.
- Use this distance to define the first class of risk (class 1).
  
#+attr_latex: :width 8cm
[[file:figs/get_started/perc_dist.png]]

*** From distance to risk class

- Distances below the threshold are transformed into classes of deforestation risk.
- A geometric series is used for that, ensuring that classes have a wider range for bigger distances.
- We define 29 additional classes of risk from 2 to 30 (class 1 has already been defined).

#+attr_latex: :width 10cm
[[file:figs/dist_class.png]]

*** Classes from subjurisdictions

- Each subjurisdiction get a number from 1 to (potentially) 999.
- We combine classes derived from distance with subjurisdictions in the following way: $\textbf{DD}\text{SSS}$, with *DD* the distance class and SSS the subjurisdiction number.
- We obtain classes going from 01001 to potentially 30999 if there are 999 subjurisdictions.
- So for 10 subjurisdictions, we obtain ~300 classes (but some distance classes might be missing).

*** Classes from subjurisdictions

- Following these steps, we obtain a map at the jurisdictional level where each forest pixel belongs to a given class of deforestation risk.
- Area in dark green: classes $\mathbf{1}\text{SSS}$, beyond the deforestation threshold.

#+end_center

*** Deforestation density

- Each class $i$ has an associated *deforestation probability*: $\theta_{m,i} = d_{i} / n_{i}$ (unitless), with $d_{i}$ the number of deforested pixels during the period, and $n_{i}$ the number of forest pixels at the beginning of the period.
- *Quantity adjustment $\rho$*: $\theta_{a,i} = \rho \theta_{m,i}$, so that total predicted deforestation = observed (or expected) deforestation. For the benchmark model for the calibration and historical periods, $\rho=1$.
- *Deforestation density (in ha/yr per pixel)* computed as $\delta_{i} = \theta_{a,i} \times A / T$. $A$: pixel area (in ha), $T$: time-interval of the period (in yr).
- The deforestation density is used to predict the amount of deforestation for each pixel belonging to a given class of deforestation risk.

** Alternative models and validation

*** Alternative models

- Alternative maps from alternative models must be compared with the benchmark model.
- The alternative model can be of different forms: geoprocessing model (moving window), statistical model (iCAR, GLM, RF).
- E.g. Clark Labs propose the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) statistical model in the Land Change Modeller module of the [[https://clarklabs.org/terrset/][TerrSet]] software.

*** Alternative models

- A risk map with deforestation densities derived from the alternative model must be provided.

#+caption: Risk map obtained with a moving window model.
#+attr_latex: :width 4.5cm
[[file:figs/prob_mw_11_t1.png]]

*** Validation procedure

- Comparing predicted vs. observed deforestation (in ha) in a coarse grid.
- For a given period of time.

#+caption: Coarse grid covering the area of interest.
#+attr_latex: :width 4.5cm
[[file:figs/grid.png]]

*** Validation procedure

- Comparing predicted vs. observed deforestation.
- Performance indices: $R^2$, and median of absolute error (MedAE).

#+attr_latex: :width 6.5cm
[[file:figs/get_started/pred_obs_icar_validation_50.png]]

*** Validation procedure

- Performance indices are computed for each model.
- The model with the higher $R^2$ and the lower MedAE is selected.

|   604 | validation | mw_21 |  2.51 | 0.56 | 7.54 |  6.66 |

*** Validation procedure

#+name: tab-periods
[[file:figs/periods.png]]

- We can compare predicted vs. observed deforestation for three time periods: *calibration*, *validation*, and *historical period*.
- To estimate model performance at forecasting deforestation in the future: *predicted vs. observed deforestation* for the *validation period* with a model fitted over the *calibration period*.
- This way, we use *independent observations* of deforestation for model validation (observed deforestation over the validation period have not be used to calibrate the model).
- Verra's methodology: the alternative model must be better for both the calibration and validation periods.

*** Verra/Clark Labs software

#+attr_latex: :width 6cm
[[file:figs/verra_tool.png]]

- User must provide rasters: forest cover change, distance to forest edge at several dates, subjurisdictional borders, alternative risk maps at several dates.
- Using this data, the UDef-ARP provides the basis:
  - for developing a benchmark model.
  - for comparing the benchmark and alternative models.

*** Limitations

- No tool to help prepare the data.
- No tool to help develop the *alternative models*.
- Windows only (at the moment).
- Require a computer with high RAM for large jurisdiction: all rasters are stored in RAM during processing. Therefore, large jurisdictions will *require substantial RAM allocations* (e.g., 64Gb).
- Use of Float data for risk maps with deforestation density (ha/pixel/yr): *large space on disk*.
- Documentation in English only, *no translations available*.
- Recent tool, some feedbacks from users (e.g. Fronterra): [[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fron-terra_forest-carbon-climatechange-activity-7179166090042732544-YnAK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop][Post 1]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fron-terra_forest-carbon-climatechange-activity-7179721587267371008-PRXr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop][Post 2]], [[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fron-terra_carbon-climatechange-verra-activity-7180971577746862080-rolc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop][Post 3]].

*Great programs* with many applications. Many scientific studies, published in a large number of scientific articles, have used these programs.

** Limitations

*** Limitations

- Not all are open source (e.g. Dinamica EGO and LCM): *transparency*.
- Not all are free (e.g. LCM): but discount for student and developing countries.
- Not all allow scripting (e.g. LCM, CLUE): *reproducibility*.
- Might not work with high resolution (<= 30 m) rasters on large jurisdictions (country scale).
- Limited number of statistical models for modelling land use change: limited accuracy and over-fitting.

*** Limitations

- Verra's methodology includes *several steps* (calibration, validation, forecast), which must be *repeated* (model, period).
- It must be possible to follow Verra's methodology with one of these programs (given some requirements, such as high RAM computer).
- But it would require a lot of work for the user to adapt the use of the program to Verra's methodology (e.g. validation step with coarse grid).

- *Note*: in the documentation for UDef-ARP, Clark Labs indicates plans to offer a utility to facilitate the creation of vulnerability maps for alternative models in the near future.

* Conclusion

** A not so simple methodology

*** Summary

- We need a *map of the deforestation risk* at the *jurisdictional level*.
- Deforestation risk: *deforestation density* in ha/pixel/yr.
- This map should be better than the map derived from the benchmark model.
- The best map will be used to *allocate deforestation* to projects within the jurisdiction.

*** A not so simple methodology

- Risk map must be obtained following Verra/Clark Labs methodology.
- The methodology was developed with simplicity in mind.
- But modelling deforestation is inherently complicated and model comparison and validation require a minimal number of steps.
- This makes hard to develop an alternative model better than the benchmark model using existing tools.

** Need for an integrative tool: deforisk QGIS plugin

*** Need for an integrative tool: the deforisk QGIS plugin

- A utility to facilitate the creation of risk maps for alternative models is needed.
- Specificities:
  - *Integrative*: all the steps of Verra's methodology (benchmark model, alternative models, validation, allocation).
  - *Accuracy*: high accuracy for forecasting deforestation.
  - *Easy to use*: simple interface with documentation.
  - *Transparent and reproducible*: using open-source software (important for carbon/biodiversity credit certification).
