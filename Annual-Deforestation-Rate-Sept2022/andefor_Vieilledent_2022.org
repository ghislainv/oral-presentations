* Introduction

** Context

*** Observations of deforestation                                               

- Historical deforestation maps are often derived from the analysis of satellite images (eg. Landsat).
- Deforestation is a rare event (< 1%/yr) and is very variable from one year to another.
- Deforestation is often observed and estimated for a period of time $T$ of several years (eg. 5 or 10 years).

*** Annual deforestation rate

- To be able to compare deforestation intensity between regions (eg. countries) and time periods of different lengths (eg. 5 or 10 years), we need to compute a **mean annual deforestation rate** $d$ in %/yr (also denoted %.yr$^{-1}$).
- Several formulas have been proposed to compute $d$ from the observed deforestation rate $d'$ on a given period of time $T$.
- $d' = (A_0-A_T)/A_0$, with $A_0$: initial forest cover at time $t=0$, and $A_T$: forest cover at time $t=T$ with $T > 1$.

** Objectives

*** Objectives

- Compare the different formulas used to compute the **mean annual deforestation rate** $d$ in %/yr.
- Propose an appropriate formula for the JNR risk mapping tool.

**** Areas and time

- $A_t$: forest area (in ha or km$^2$) at time $t$ with $t=0,\ldots,T$.
- $A_0 > A_1 > A_2 > \ldots > A_T$.
- $T$: time-interval (in yr), $T > 1$.
  
**** Deforestation **rates**

- $d'$: observed deforestation rate for period of time $T$. \\
  $d' = (A_0-A_T)/A_0$, in %.
- $d$: **mean annual deforestation rate** over the period of time $T$. \\
  e.g. $d=(A_0-A_1)/A_0$, in %/yr.
- $d$ must be constant over the period of time $T$. \\
  $d=(A_0-A_1)/A_0=(A_1-A_2)/A_1=\ldots_{}$.

How to compute $d$ from $A_0$, $A_T$ and $T$ (or from $d'$ and $T$ as $d' = (A_0-A_T)/A_0$)?

**** Proposed formulas

- FAO formula \\
  $r = (A_T/A_0)^{(1/T)}-1$

- Following FAO definition, $r$ is a mean **annual rate of change**, not a mean annual rate of **deforestation**.
- This rate is zero if $A_T = A_0$ (no change), positive if $A_T > A_0$ (increase in forest cover), and negative if $A_T <= A_0$ (deforestation). This equation is perfectly OK when correctly interpreted.
- In the Verra document about JNR mapping risk methodology, there is a misinterpretation of $r$ described as the deforestation or forest degradation rate (see p. 8 of the document).
- To obtain a deforestation rate (which is assumed positive), we need the opposite:\\
  $d = 1 - (A_T/A_0)^{1/T}$

- This formula is just the **opposite** of the FAO rate cited by Verra:\\
  $d = 1 - r$, with $r = (A_T/A_0)^{(1/T)}-1$.
- Can be easily demonstrated mathematically.
- Note that $d = 1 - (1 - d')^{1/T} \Leftrightarrow d' = 1 - (1 - d)^{T}$
- This explains the error in the =riskmapjnr= Python package (there was a confusion between $d$ and $d'$, now corrected).

* Conclusion

** Recommendation

*** Recommendation

We recommend the use of the following formula to estimate the **mean annual deforestation rate**:\\
\vspace{0.25cm}

\centering **$d = 1 - (1 - d')^{1/T}$** equivalent to **$d = 1 - (A_T/A_0)^{1/T}$**

** Demonstration of the formula

*** Demonstration

We demonstrate that **$d = 1 - (1 - d')^{1/T}$**: \\
\vspace{0.25cm}

We have: $A_0 > A_1 > A_2 > \ldots > A_T$ \\
Then, $A_1 = A_0 - d \times A_0 = A_0 (1-d)$ \\
$A_2 = A_1 - d \times A_1 = A_1 (1-d) = A_0 (1-d) (1-d) = A_0 (1-d)^2$ \\
$\ldots$ \\
$A_T = A_0 (1-d)^T$ \Leftrightarrow A_T/A_0=(1-d)^T **(1)** \\
\vspace{0.25cm}

By definition, d'=(A_0-A_T)/A_0 **(2)** \\
\vspace{0.25cm}

**(1)** and **(2)** \Rightarrow $d' = 1 - (1-d)^T$ **(3)** \\
$(1-d)^T = 1-d'$ \\
$1-d = (1-d')^{1/T}$ \\
**$d = 1 - (1 - d')^{1/T}$ (4)**
